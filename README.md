# U.S. Medical Insurance
## Description
The goal of this project is to analyze data from a CSV file about a patient's medical insurance costs using **Python lists** and **dictionaries**. The **Jupyter Notebook** will also demonstrate the usage of custom **functions** and **loops** in Python. 

While **Pandas DataFrames** could also be used for this analysis, the goal was to showcase how the data analysis could be done mainly with base Python and custom functions.

## Files

* `US_Medical_Insurance` - contains the Python code used to analyze the dataset

## Technologies
* Python: `csv`, `statistics`, `Counter`, `NumPy`, `SciPy`
